During this time, I had the privilege of learning from brilliant minds from all around the world, and got the chance to co-author seminal papers in the realm of Higgs boson physics. In 2018, after completing my PhD, my career trajectory shifted towards machine learning, and I was fortunate to join the research group of Mr LSTM Sepp Hochreiter in Linz. Under Sepp\u0026rsquo;s mentorship, I delved into the intricacies of machine learning and modern deep learning over a span of 2.5 years.\nFrom 2021 to 2023, I had the pleasure of spending three remarkable years in Amsterdam. Initially, I was part of the Amsterdam Machine Learning Lab lead by Max Welling, and subsequently joined Microsoft Research for 2 years. During this period, my passion for Geometric Deep Learning, particularly involving Geometric (Clifford) algebras, and my interest in partial differential equations (PDEs), with a particular focus on developing neural surrogates for (PDEs), became profound. Most importantly, I pivoted towards large-scale PDEs, including weather and climate modeling, which culminated in Aurora.\nMy years in Amsterdam have shaped my research vision.

I am firmly convinced that AI is on the cusp of disrupting simulations at industry-scale. Therefore, I have started a new group at JKU Linz which has strong computer vision, numerical simulation, and engineering components. We want to advance data-driven simulations at industry-scale, and place the Austrian industry engine Linz as a center for doing that.\nAbout my research Working in high energy physics means to make the invisible visible. When we published for example the first direct observation of the Higgs boson decaying into pairs of tau leptons non of the processes, i.e., the Higgs boson signal itself nor the many \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;background\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; processes, was measured directly. Everything needed to be reconstructed from terabytes of detector data, and \u0026ndash; even more fascinating to me \u0026ndash; by using sophisticated physical simulations.\nMy first contact with simulations in the context of Deep Learning was through the work on Boundary graph neural networks for 3D simulations, which was financed by the Austrian Research Promotion Agency (FFG) after winning a research grant together with DCS computing.\nDuring my years in Amsterdam I fully pivoted towards neural modeling of partial differential equations (PDEs). For example:\n In Message Passing Neural PDE Solvers, we replaced all heuristically designed components in numerical PDE solvers with backprop-optimized neural function approximators. We studied how to use Lie Point Symmetries of PDEs to improve sample complexity of neural PDE solvers. In Clifford Neural Layers for PDE Modeling and Geometric Clifford Algebra Networks, we introduced neural network layers for PDE modeling, which are based on operations on composite objects of scalars, vectors, and higher order objects. In Towards Multi-spatiotemporal-scale Generalized PDE Modeling, we introduce PDEArena, a modern PyTorch Lightning-based deep learning framework for neural PDE modeling with a plethora of state-of-the art neural PDE surrogates and various temporal PDEs in 1-, 2-, and 3-spatial dimensions. In ClimaX, we developed a flexible and generalizable deep learning model for weather and climate science that can be trained using heterogeneous datasets. ClimaX is the first foundation model for weather and climate.  How to disrupt simulations at industry-scale Recent years have shown that scalable ideas, improving the datasets, and clever engineering are the ingredients for ever better Deep Learning systems. LLMs and large-scale computer vision models have given birth to the heavily overused term \u0026ldquo;foundation model\u0026rdquo;. After language and computer vision, foundation models have spread over to various disciplines, with AlphaFold as very prominent example.\nI want to go one step further, and bring foundation models to the every-day engineering world, and in doing so, disrupt how our industry works. Every day thousands and thousands of compute hours are spent on turbulence modeling, simulations of fluid or air flows, heat transfer in materials, traffic flows, and many more. Many of these processes follow similar underlying patterns, but yet need different and extremely specialized softward to simulate. Even worse, for different parameter settings the costly simulations need to be run at full length from scratch.\nThis is what I want to change! Deep Learning techniques are ready to develope models which run simulations in seconds instead of days or even weeks. The hardware is ready to digest high-resolutional industry-scale inputs, e.g., 3D meshes or images, and subsequently sets the stage to train Deep Learning models at scale.\nBut what about the data you might ask? Don\u0026rsquo;t we need high-quality ground truth data, which usually must come from the very simulations we are going to replace, presenting us with a proverbial chicken-and-egg problem? Luckily, many of the above mentioned processes have common underlying dynamics \u0026ndash; similar to how different languages share structure and grammar. Simulation data is abundant, we just need to use the right ones, and many of that.\nPersonally, I have experienced modern computer vision as one of the driving tools for developing data-driven simulations. But it will take much more. It will need expertise in numerical simulations, geometric and physics-informed deep learning, and engineering at scale. We have already put together a very strong interdisciplinary team with different expertise, and keep hiring. The journey is going to be exciting.\nStay stuned, first works will appear soon ","date":1696118400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1696118400,"objectID":"2fd9e67842e8975b7bf6578bf0ece1fe","permalink":"https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/research/data-driven-simulations/","publishdate":"2023-10-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/data-driven-simulations/","section":"research","summary":"I am firmly convinced that AI is on the cusp of disrupting simulations at industry-scale.

This totally coincides with my experience, and \u0026ndash; needless to say \u0026ndash; I will continue working on general large-scale Deep Learning directions.\nIn Reinforcement Learning, we introduce RUDDER a novel model-free RL approach to overcome delayed reward problems. RUDDER directly and efficiently assigns credit to reward-causing state-action pairs and thereby speeds up learning in model-free reinforcement learning with delayed rewards dramatically. I have written a lengthy blogpost on the RUDDER idea. With Align-RUDDER, we extended the RUDDER framework by assuming that episodes with high rewards are given as demonstrations. Finally, we prove converge for actor-critic methods like RUDDER or PPO.\nIn Hopfield Networks is All You Need, we introduced a new energy function and a corresponding new update rule which is guaranteed to converge to a local minimum of the energy function. The new modern Hopfield Network with continuous states keeps the characteristics of its discrete counterparts, i.e., exponential storage capacity and fast convergence. Due to its continuous states this new modern Hopfield Network is differentiable and can be integrated into deep learning architectures. Typically patterns are retrieved after one update which is compatible with activating the layers of deep networks. Surprisingly, the new update rule is the attention mechanism of transformer networks introduced in Attention Is All You Need. I have written a lenthy blogpost on modern Hopfield Networks. One SOTA application of modern Hopfield Networks can be found in our paper Modern Hopfield Networks and Attention for Immune Repertoire Classification. Here, the high storage capacity of modern Hopfield Networks is exploited to solve a challenging multiple instance learning (MIL) problem in computational biology called immune repertoire classification. Finally, we found out that linearized attention models, such as the Performer idea resemble the update rule of classical Hopfield Networks. Our blogpost was published in the ICLR2022 blogpost track.\nI will keep working on understanding large scale architectures. There are quite a few interesting projects I am involved in.\nStay stuned for new work ","date":1530403200,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1530403200,"objectID":"ceaa985865bea43cb19782f318319faf","permalink":"https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/research/deep-learning/","publishdate":"2018-07-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/deep-learning/","section":"research","summary":"After switching from High Energy Physics to Deep Learning, I started working in Reinforcement Learning before pivoting towards Associative Memories and modern Transformer networks.

Most of my research was dedicated to Higgs boson physics.\nMy work was on statistical and physics analysis which means making sense of terabytes of data collected by the CMS detector at the Large Hadron Collider (LHC). Doing physics analysis also means to make the unvisible visible. For example, neither the Higgs boson itself nor the many \u0026lsquo;\u0026lsquo;background\u0026rsquo;\u0026rsquo; processes can be measured directly. Worse, even most of the decay products cannot be measured directly. Consequently, everything needs to be reconstructed from terabytes of detector data by using sophisticated software tools and physical simulations.\nOne of my biggest contributions was to develope the so-called Fake Factor Method. The fake factor method is a fully data-driven background estimation method for the most important background processes of the standard model Higgs boson and potential supersymmetric twins. Fully data-driven means that only directly recorded collision data is needed in contrast to standard background estimation methods which require tons of simulation data. This makes the fake factor method more robust and scalable. The fake factor method is still used as go-to tool in modern Higgs boson analyses.\n","date":1388534400,"expirydate":-62135596800,"kind":"page","lang":"en","lastmod":1388534400,"objectID":"580974cca7861d0b790e5a631a75ab7e","permalink":"https://brandstetter-johannes.github.io/research/high-energy-physics/","publishdate":"2014-01-01T00:00:00Z","relpermalink":"/research/high-energy-physics/","section":"research","summary":"I have spent five years (including my PhD) working in the CMS Collaboration at CERN.
