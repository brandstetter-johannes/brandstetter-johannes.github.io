**About Emmi AI**

At Emmi AI, we believe that the next frontier of industrial engineering lies at the intersection of artificial intelligence and physics. The world of large-scale engineering and manufacturing is ripe for transformation, yet today's innovation processes are hindered by slow, costly simulations and prohibitive computational requirements.

Emmi AI is here to change that.

Our vision is bold: to pioneer universally applicable AI-driven physics simulation models that accelerate engineering and manufacturing processes across industries – from aviation and energy to semiconductors, automotive and chemicals. We aim to enable real-time interaction, streamline production planning, and unlock new possibilities in design optimization.

The future we envision is one where AI surrogates reduce computational costs, foster rapid innovation, and drive industrial-scale engineering at unprecedented speeds. Our starting point is computational fluid dynamics (CFD), but our ambition extends to real-time adaptive simulations and multi-physics models.

Industrial-scale problems demand industrial-scale solutions. Much like medium-range weather forecasting challenged deep learning due to its scale, industrial simulations with tens of millions of mesh cells present a similar challenge – one we are ready to tackle. We are inspired by the ambition and intellectual rigor of Emmy Noether, whose groundbreaking contributions to physics mirror our commitment to redefining industrial engineering.

Emmi AI is not just building models; we are building the future of industrial innovation. As we scale, we seek partners who share our conviction: that AI is not merely a tool, but a catalyst for transforming how we design, build, and innovate.

To our investors, collaborators, and future team members – join us as we push the boundaries of what’s possible. Together, we will unlock a new era of efficiency, creativity, and excellence in engineering.

Let's build the future!
