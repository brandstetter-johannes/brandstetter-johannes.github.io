**Mission statement of NXAI**

With NXAI, we are building an European AI hub that comprises world-class research, close ties to local universities, and strong industrial know-how and support. Our mission is to create a large-scale entrepreneurial framework to transform latest scientific developments into industrial-ready applications. 

At its core, NXAI is dedicated to independent research, which we believe is our greatest strength. However, we aspire to go further. We are building a pipeline that converts our research into high-impact industrial applications. Our goal is to become a nimble AI powerhouse at the forefront of the AI revolution in Europe.

Our research focus is on two key areas. The first is AI4Simulation, where we are building foundational models for industrial simulations. The second is Large Language Models (LLMs), highlighted by our flagship project xLSTM. In both domains, we have world-leading experts committed to unlocking the vast potential for creating downstream applications for engineering and industrial use cases
